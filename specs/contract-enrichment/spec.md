# Contract Enrichment — Level 2 for all View types

Make the generated TypeScript strong enough to replace the hand-written types:
literal-union enums, honest nullability, required fields, and date formats on
all 17 response views.

## Why

The pipeline (Go → swaggo → Kubb → TypeScript) is wired and proven, but the Go
structs carry almost no schema information, so what comes out the far end is
weaker than the types it is meant to replace:

```ts
status?: string;    // could be anything
notes?: string;     // absent, or null, or a value? unknowable
id?: string;        // is it ever missing? no
```

Generating from that would be a downgrade — `tsc` would stop catching things it
catches today. The enrichment is what makes generated types worth having.

`task.TaskView` is already done and is the reference implementation: it went
from 22 loosely-typed fields to 13 required, 4 enums, 9 nullable, 5 formatted.
16 views and 134 fields remain.

There is a second prize. Enum values currently live in up to five places that
agree only by luck — the DB `CHECK` constraint, unexported service consts,
inline string comparisons in handlers, hardcoded JSON strings in
`internal/domain/ai/tools.go`, and the TypeScript constants. A named Go type
collapses those into one definition the compiler enforces.

## Scope

### In

- Named Go enum types + consts for every enumerated wire field
- `extensions:"x-nullable"` on every pointer field in a View
- `validate:"required"` on every always-populated non-pointer field
- `format:"date"` / `format:"date-time"` on date and timestamp fields
- Repointing existing untyped consts and inline comparisons at the new types

Each type is aligned **everywhere it is used, in the same change**: the Go
struct, the generated TypeScript, and every call site in `nicoflow-shared`,
`nicoflow-frontend` and `nicoflow-mobile`. A type is not done until all four
repos compile against the real name.

**Request bodies** are part of the contract too — a client that sends the wrong
shape is as broken as one that misreads a response. 32 `*Request` types, 100
fields, enriched and generated alongside the views.

Two of them (`task.UpdateTaskRequest`, `project.UpdateProjectRequest`) emit
**zero properties** today: they use `optional.Field[T]` generics that swaggo
cannot introspect, so the generated TypeScript is an empty object and the
contract for those endpoints is silently missing. Fixing that needs a swaggo
type override, not just tags.

**Zod schemas** hardcode the same enum values in 5 places
(`z.enum(['active','done','cancelled'])` and friends) — a fourth copy of values
that already exist in the DB CHECK, the Go consts, and the generated union. They
are rewritten to derive from the generated type, so a value can only be added in
one place.

### Out

Nothing. Every wire type, every consumer, every duplicate definition.

## Non-Goals

- Hand-authoring OpenAPI. The Go structs stay the source of truth.
- Redesigning endpoints. The shape stays what it is; only its description
  becomes accurate.
- Retyping domain models. Only the wire structs are enriched; the domain layer
  keeps plain strings so SQL scanning is untouched.
- **Alias shims.** No `export type ITask = TaskView`. An alias leaves two names
  for one thing and defers the rename indefinitely — the call sites keep saying
  `ITask` and nobody ever goes back. Delete the hand-written interface and fix
  the imports in the same change, so there is exactly one name for each type.

## Contract

**Enums — declare a named type, let swaggo do the rest.** No `enums:"..."` tag
is needed; swaggo reads the ordered consts.

```go
type TaskStatus string

const (
    TaskStatusActive    TaskStatus = "active"
    TaskStatusDone      TaskStatus = "done"
    TaskStatusCancelled TaskStatus = "cancelled"
)
```

**Nullability is already in the Go type system.** A pointer field is nullable, a
value field is not. Mark it so Kubb emits `| null`:

```go
Notes        *string `json:"notes" extensions:"x-nullable"`
CreatedAt    string  `json:"createdAt" format:"date-time" validate:"required"`
ScheduledFor *string `json:"scheduledFor" format:"date" extensions:"x-nullable"`
```

**Convert at the view boundary**, not in the domain model:

```go
Status: TaskStatus(t.Status),
```

For a nullable enum, use a small helper that preserves nil — see
`occurrenceStatusPtr` in `internal/domain/task/types.go`.

**Known enum values.** Where the DB has a `CHECK`, it wins:

| Field                    | Values                                     | Source                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `tasks.status`           | `active` `done` `cancelled`                | CHECK (migration 025)       |
| `projects.status`        | `active` `completed` `archived`            | `project/handler.go:242`    |
| `recurrence.freq`        | `daily` `weekly` `monthly` `yearly`        | CHECK                       |
| `habits.polarity`        | `build` `quit`                             | CHECK + `habit/types.go:28` |
| `habits.schedule_kind`   | `daily` `weekdays` `weekly_quota`          | CHECK                       |
| google connection status | `pending` `confirmed` `rejected` `expired` | CHECK                       |
| notification `type`      | 12 values                                  | `notification/types.go:11`  |

If Go and the DB disagree, that is a real bug. Record it in `blockers.md` — do
not pick a side.

## Design Risks

| Risk                                                    | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A correction rejects a request that used to be accepted | This is the deliberate part, and the sharpest risk. Marking a request field required makes the API reject bodies it previously tolerated, and a shipped client may be sending exactly those. Before correcting a **request** field, confirm no consumer omits it — `tsc` across the three TypeScript repos is the check, and a caller that cannot supply it is a blocker, not a rename |
| A response correction breaks a client                   | Narrowing a response (optional → required, nullable → not) is safe for readers; widening is not. Never make a response field nullable that clients currently treat as always-present without listing it as a breaking change                                                                                                                                                           |
| Corrections pile up unnoticed                           | Every one is listed in the PR body with old and new behaviour. A silent contract change is the failure this work exists to prevent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Named type breaks a caller                              | The compiler finds every one — that is the point. `TaskView` surfaced exactly one, in `cmd/api/main.go`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Test Strategy

| Layer                               | Covers                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `make build`                        | the named types compile and every caller was updated         |
| `go test ./internal/domain/<d>/...` | no behavioural change in the domain                          |
| `make swagger` + inspect definition | enum/required/nullable/format actually emitted               |
| `pnpm codegen` + `tsc`              | generated TypeScript is valid and self-consistent            |
| `pnpm codegen:check`                | generated output committed and in sync                       |
| existing handler tests              | a changed assertion means the wire moved — justify or revert |

## Rollout

One type at a time, all the way through every repo that uses it:

1. Enrich the Go struct, `make swagger`, `make build`, domain tests
2. `pnpm codegen` in `nicoflow-shared`
3. Delete the hand-written interface for that type
4. Fix every call site `tsc` names — in shared, frontend and mobile
5. All four repos green

A type is done only after step 5. Half-migrated is worse than not started: two
names for one shape, and no compiler pressure to finish.

Order is smallest-blast-radius first, so a mistake in the pattern is caught on a
2-field view rather than a 22-field one:

`habit.SubjectView` → `auth.CalendarPrefsView` → `googlecal.CalendarView` →
`habit.CellView` → `note.NoteView` → `note.NoteDetailView` → `area.AreaView` →
`task.SubtaskView` → `area.AreaWithProjectsView` → `notification.PreferencesView` →
`bucket.BucketView` → `notification.NotificationView` → `auth.UserView` →
`project.ProjectView` → `googlecal.GoogleEventView` → `habit.HabitView`

**Rollback:** each domain is one commit touching one `types.go` plus regenerated
artifacts. `git revert` restores the previous contract exactly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1** Every `*View` definition in `docs/swagger.json` has a non-empty
      `required` array listing exactly its non-pointer fields.
- [ ] **AC2** Every pointer field in a `*View` carries `x-nullable: true` in
      `docs/swagger.json`, and its generated TypeScript is `| null`.
- [ ] **AC3** Every enumerated wire field is a named Go type whose values match
      the table in this spec, and its generated TypeScript is a literal union
      rather than `string`.
- [ ] **AC4** Every date or timestamp field carries `format: date` or
      `format: date-time`.
- [ ] **AC5** `make build` and `go test ./...` pass. Where enrichment reveals a
      contract that was wrong — a field marked optional that the handler always
      requires, a nullable that is never null — the contract is **corrected**,
      not preserved. Every such change is listed in the PR description with the
      old and new behaviour, and its handler test is updated to assert the
      corrected shape.
- [ ] **AC6** `pnpm type-check` passes in `nicoflow-shared` and
      `pnpm codegen:check` exits 0.
- [ ] **AC7** No enum value is defined in more than one Go location: the former
      unexported consts, inline comparisons, and the hardcoded schema strings in
      `internal/domain/ai/tools.go` all reference the named types.
- [ ] **AC8** Every hand-written interface that duplicates a generated type is
      deleted, and no alias re-export of one exists (`export type ITask =
    TaskView` and the like). Exactly one name per shape, across all four repos.
- [ ] **AC9** `pnpm type-check` passes in `nicoflow-frontend` and
      `nicoflow-mobile` against the generated types, with no `as` cast or local
      re-declaration introduced to get there.
- [ ] **AC10** Every `*Request` definition carries `required`, enums, formats
      and nullability on the same terms as the views.
- [ ] **AC11** No definition emits zero properties. `task.UpdateTaskRequest` and
      `project.UpdateProjectRequest` currently do, because `optional.Field[T]`
      is opaque to swaggo — both describe their real shape.
- [ ] **AC12** No Zod schema hardcodes an enum's values. Each derives from the
      generated type, so adding a value in Go is the only way to add one.
- [ ] **AC13** Searching the four repos for any enum's value set returns exactly
      one definition — the Go named type — plus the generated output and the DB
      CHECK that constrains it.
